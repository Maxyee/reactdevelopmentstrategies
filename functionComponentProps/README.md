## Function Component Props

For running this project, we just need to run only two command from our project directory.

One:

`npm install`

this command will install all the necessary library for this project.

Two:

`npm start`

This command will start our project. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### Main topic discussion

here in this folder or project I tried to understand how `Props` work in reactjs. What I understand is that, if i want to 
pass data one component to another then i should use this props element. This props can pass single data as well as multiple object into the component.
