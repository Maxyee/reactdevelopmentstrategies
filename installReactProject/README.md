[Read this blog where I wrote how to install Nodejs](https://github.com/Maxyee/nodejs_logics/tree/master/InstallNodejs)

After installing the nodejs into our local machine, now we need to run some command for installing
reactjs project. commands are given below:

```bash
npx create-react-app my-app  
cd my-app
npm start

```

here `my-app` is our project directory.if we want to change the directory name then we can follow
command like this way

```bash
npx create-react-app myproject
cd myproject
npm start

```

that's all! In this way we can install our reactjs project
